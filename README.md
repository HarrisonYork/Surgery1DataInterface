# SurgiScan
Repository for display of data gained through use of the tag tracker device. Part of the Surgery 1, EGR101 project at Duke University.

Getting Started:

data/data.csv
This is the .csv file of scans from the Arduino. You can copy and paste the file from an SD Card or just replace the existing file. Make sure it has the same name (data.csv) if replacing.

data/map.csv
This is a list of tag ids to tag names. It is customizable. Write each tag id as the first string of each line, followed by a comma. The second string is the name itself. This can be anything you would like and it should represent the object that the tag is attached to.
